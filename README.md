## TODO
1. Review code looking for unused functions and other misc. code that needs updating
2. Add a configuration page for local time zone, and current user.

## TODONE
* Refactor Food Snapshots to mimick objective and subjective snapshot database models (from a document for each day to just one collections, i.e. flattening the database structure out a bit)
* Refactor the UTC to local time conversions to a simpler form (ie only save the local time in the database)
* Add daily reviews for each snapshot
